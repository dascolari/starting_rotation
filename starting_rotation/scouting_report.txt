Due to the size of datasets in this folder, we gitignore all .csv files
archive.zip is in our repository holds some of the data
download pitches.zip from one of the below links to get pitches data


data is from here: http://inalitic.com/datasets/mlb%20pitch%20data.html

Each observation is a pitch with an at bat identifier. 
pitcher and batter ids will need to be merged on (but i think this is relatively easy given the good gaggle data available). 

basically everything we need and way more is just there
velo
location
tipe
spin stuff(rate, direction, break, etc)
game situation (puts inning runners on etc)

our tasks
1. a model(s) that predicts (pitch type, xlocation, zlocation)
 - "nested" conditional probability models (what we've been doing but 3 of them that build on each other)
 - or just three separate models that predict the three coords independently	
2. cluster types of at bats
 - usually certain counts, number of outs, situations are labeled as: 
	hitters count, bunt situation, rbi situation ect. 
 - let's see if we can identify clusters as such
 
3. corollaries of our pitch predictor
 - perhaps certain pitchers will have higher rmse (or other modelperformance measure) than others. 
 - aka some pitchers are more predictable than others
 - does this coincide with who we think are the best pitchers in the league?
 - are there any pitchers who we know what they're throwing (Uroldis chapman's fastball) but hitters still can't touch them 
 - "scouting reports"
	x pitcher always throws pitch-y after pitch-x

4. predict good time to steal for runner on first base to steal
 - trying to predict low pitch speed, high break, low pitch location 
 - good time to steal
 - perhaps can also look at pickoffs
 - this might just be part of our main pitch predictor model

5. some sick graphs
 - strike zones
 - graphics that show game situations

initial tasks
 - try to bucket some of the less frequent pitches
 - probably subset by pitcher
 - build an initial run of the model based on any features that we have
	- only use pitch information from the previous pitch
	- OK to use game situation of current pitch
